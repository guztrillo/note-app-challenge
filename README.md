# Ensolvers Challenge

This is a Challenge from a Site.

## Live Link:

Here is the SPA online: 

[Notes App Challenge](https://guztrillo.github.io/note-app-challenge/)

## Stack:

- React (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer)
- Pure CSS
- JavaScript
- Semantic HTML

## Packages:

Here some packages I did use with this challenge:

- UUID
- React-Icons
- React-Modal
- Swalalert2

## Process

For this challenge I wanted to take a simply approach.

First of all, I selected React useContext and useReducer as my state manager. The first step I did was to build the logic behind the modal, that's the hardest part here.

Later, when I had the basic functionality of the application, I decided to add styles using pure CSS. No media queries using display grid and grid-template-columns.

Then I added more details, like the confirmation dialog for the delete note and persistent data with localStorage. As a front-end developer I wanted that I least the app was somehow functional and with LocalStorage I accomplish this.

I still wanted to finish 'archive notes' section.
